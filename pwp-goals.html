<h2><a href="index.html">Home Page</a></h2>
<h2><a href="persona.html">User Persona/User Story</a></h2>

<h3>1. Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this website will be to create a professional portfolio that I can provide prospective employers with to get a feel for my work.</p>

<h3>2. Audience</h3>
<p>The audience for this website will be for prospective employers/clients and potentially other developers.</p>

<h3>3. Goals</h3>
<p>My goal for this website is to produce a clean, well designed portfolio/landing page to act as a gallery to showcase my work, and exhibit a strong design sense. The primary end result from this project is to lead me towards full time work. A secondary goal is to produce something both I and my instructors are proud of and for it to be used as an example in future cohorts.
